## ðŸ”¬ Capstone Project â€“ Tritium Extraction System for Fusion Reactors

As part of a three-member team for our UC Berkeley Capstone Project, we designed a **tritium extraction system** for compact fusion reactors, under the guidance of **Dr. Guanyu Su**. The project was entirely simulation-based and utilized **Star-CCM+** and **SolidWorks**â€”software none of us had used before this project.

Together, we developed a realistic model simulating **tritium transport from FLiBe to the vacuum**, including **permeation through metallic walls**. After building the core model collaboratively, I led a **sensitivity study** on segment length to analyze how **heat exchanger geometry affects tritium extraction efficiency**.

Through this experience, I gained practical skills in:
- **Meshing complex geometries**
- **Defining custom boundary conditions** using user-defined equations
- Using **passive scalars** to simulate species transport in a multiphysics environment
